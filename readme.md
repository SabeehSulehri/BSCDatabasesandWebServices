Description:

Health and fitness are crucial components of overall well-being, and tracking your health and fitness can play a significant role in achieving and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Thus, me and my team thought of a Health and Fitness Tracker that creates a web service that helps users track their fitness goals, diet, and exercise routines. Store health data in a database and provide recommendations and historic progress. The way the user interacts with the system:

• User login – for registering to the system

• User dashboard – where they can see the summary of their fitness record

• User Input – user manually inputs their personal data and progress and goals etc.

• Notifications – user gets reminded of their scheduled workout time and goals

• Fitness tracking – user gets to input data and edit to his/her progress and liking

• List of exercises – users will enter a list of exercises and activities done such as running, weightlifting and more.

• Etc.

As for illegal actions or inputs, unauthorized users should not be able to access others’ data, users cannot input negative value such as for steps taken, and also including encryption and secure authentication processes to ensure security measures.
